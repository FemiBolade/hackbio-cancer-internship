**DRUG RESISTANCE**

**Introduction**

Drug resistance is a phenomenon in which medications used in treating a disease or condition become tolerant or no longer effective. In 21<sup>st</sup> century, drug resistance has been a significant public health issue of global importance. Drug resistance occurs as result of several factors. Resistance caused by pathogens and cancer are known as antimicrobial resistance and antineoplastic resistance respectively.

**Drug resistance in cancer**

Globally, cancer remains one of the leading causes of death with increased prevalence as a result of their ability to develop resistance to different antineoplastic drugs. In the treatment of cancer patients, chemotherapy has emerged as a prominent therapeutic approach. however, clinical oncologists have found that people develop resistance to new drugs they have not before been exposed. This drastically reduces chemotherapeutic efficacy. Drug resistance can be classified as either intrinsic or acquired resistance, depending on when it develops. Drug resistance can manifest in two ways: intrinsic resistance, which is present before treatment, and acquired resistance, which develops after therapy. About half of cancer patients have these two types of resistance.

**Some mechanisms of cancer resistance**

**Increased efflux of drugs**

Chemotherapy resistance is commonly attributed to increased anticancer drug efflux, which reduces intracellular drug accumulation. Resistance to drugs can develop before or after drug delivery, making high efflux rates intrinsic or acquired.  This efflux is enabled by ABC transporter proteins in humans, which is a normal physiological function. Many drug-resistant malignancies involve three transporters: MDR1, MRP1, and BCRP. Due to their broad substrate specificity, all three transporters may efflux Vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, anthracyclines, taxanes, and kinase inhibitors from cells. Therefore, they protect cancer cells from several first-line chemotherapies.

**Alteration of Drug Targets**

A drug’s efficacy is influenced by its molecular target and alterations of this target, such as mutations or modifications of expression levels due to epigenetic alterations. For example- epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKIs like erlotinib targeting NSCLC have a high first response rate however 50% of responding patients developed a T790M EGFR mutation, making them resistant to the first and second generations of TKIs increasing ATP binding affinity and decreasing erlotinib binding to the kinase.&#x20;

 

**Conclusion**

The problem of cancer drug resistance is complicated, and given its increasing frequency, it is crucial to persist in striving to understand the basic mechanisms of cancer drug resistance and to develop treatments that may successfully combat cancers that have become resistant to existing treatments.
